# FingerPaintAI

<h2> Objective </h2>
I wanted to be more versed with REST APIs, along with using React, so this is what this project focused on. I also wanted to explore my interest in Computer Vision. 

<h2> Languages and Libraries </h2>

<strong> Languages </strong> : Python, Javascript, CSS, HTML
<strong> Frontend Libraries and Frameworks </strong> : Vite, Tailwind CSS, React
<strong> Backend Libraries and Frameworks </strong>: Flask, OpenCV, OS, Numpy, and MediaPipe

<h2> How the Project Works </h2>

When starting up the webapp using vite, a popup request shows up showing this which explain what this webapp does. <br>

The project uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect hand movements, one finger to draw, and two fingers to select specific colours. Then I used Flask to create a REST API specifically to use get, then I used react and vite, to see the how the frontend is designed.

<h2> Difficulties and Future Goals </h2>
Some difficulties faced, was learning flask in general and linking the backend and frontend. For future projects I want to be more adept in using it. Furthermore I kept the fronted very simple this time.

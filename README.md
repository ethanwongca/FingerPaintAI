# FingerPaintAI

<h2> Objective </h2>
I wanted to be more versed with REST APIs, along with using React, so this is what this project focused on. I also wanted to explore my interest in Computer Vision. 

<h2> Languages and Libraries </h2>

<strong> Languages </strong> : Python, Javascript, CSS, HTML
<strong> Frontend Libraries and Frameworks </strong> : Vite, Tailwind CSS, React
<strong> Backend Libraries and Frameworks </strong>: Flask, OpenCV, OS, NumPy, and MediaPipe

<h2> How the Project Works </h2>

When starting up the web app using Vite, a popup request shows up, which explains what this web app does. <br>

The project uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect hand movements, one finger to draw, and two fingers to select specific colours. Then I used Flask to create a REST API specifically to use get; I used React and Vite to see how the frontend is designed.

<h2> Difficulties and Future Goals </h2>
Some difficulties were learning Flask in general and linking the backend and frontend. For future projects, I want to be more adept at using it. Furthermore, I kept the fronted straightforward this time.
